# Vignette-group-14

Final Poetry Generation vignette project

# Description

Vignette on using markov chains to create a poetry generator based on particular poetry genres/styles; Model trained using Edgar Allen Poe poetry; created as a class project for PSTAT197A in Fall 2022.

# Vignette abstract

The topic of this vignette is related to using NLPs to train a poetry generator based on the type of particular authors. To do this, we used a markov chain model on a subset of data from the Project Gutenberg database, which is a digital database of written works categorized by genre, author, etc. Our subset of the data are poems from the author Edgar Allen Poe. This vignette consists of a pre-curated poetry corpus that our group made, as well as instructions on how to train a poem generator on this corpus and output a new poem. We have generated a sample poem in Edgar Allen Poe's style of poetry.

# Repository contents

The repository contains our README file with a description of our project, poetry corpus as a JSON file, the Edgar Allen Poe poetry corpus dataset, and our final vignette.

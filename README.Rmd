#Description
Vignette on using markov chains to create a poetry generator based on particular poetry genres/styles; created as a class project for PSTAT197A in Fall 2022.

#Vignette abstract
The topic of this vignette is related to using NLPs to train a poetry generator based on the type of particular authors. To do this, we used a markov chain model on a subset of data from the Project Gutenberg database, which is a digital database of written works categorized by genre, author, etc. This vignette consists of a pre-curated poetry corpus that our group made, as well as instructions on how to train a poem generator on this corpus and output a new poem.

#Repository contents
The repository contains our poetry corpus as a JSON file

{"s": "first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom", "gid": "932"}

{"s": "after-dream of the reveller upon opium--the bitter lapse into", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "everyday life--the hideous dropping off of the veil.  There was", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart--an unredeemed", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could", "gid": "932"}

{"s": "of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among", "gid": "932"}

{"s": "Nevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to", "gid": "932"}

{"s": "had been one of my boon companions in boyhood; but many years had", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "reached me in a distant part of the country--a letter from him--", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "which, in its wildly importunate nature, had admitted of no other", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "agitation.  The writer spoke of acute bodily illness--of a mental", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "attempting, by the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "of his malady.  It was the manner in which all this, and much", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "more, was said--it was the apparent heart that went with his", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "request--which allowed me no room for hesitation; and I", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "accordingly obeyed forthwith what I still considered a very", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "singular summons.", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "Although, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet", "gid": "932"}

{"s": "ancient family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "sensibility of temperament, displaying itself, through long ages,", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "in a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties of musical", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "science.  I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "stem of the Usher race, all time-honoured as it was, had put", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "forth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "the entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had", "gid": "932"}

{"s": "upon the possible influence which the one, in the long", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other--it was", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "this deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "appellation of the \"House of Usher\"--an appellation which seemed", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "to include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "family and the family mansion.", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "experiment--that of looking down within the tarn--had been to", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "deepen the first singular impression.  There can be no doubt that", "gid": "932"}

{"s": "been for this reason only, that, when I again uplifted my eyes to", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "mind a strange fancy--a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I but", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "oppressed me.  I had so worked upon my imagination as really to", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity--", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven, but", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "which had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the grey wall,", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "and the silent tarn--a pestilent and mystic vapour, dull,", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "sluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued.", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "Shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream,", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "I scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building.  Its", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity.", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "The discoloration of ages had been great.  Minute fungi", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "overspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "dilapidation.  No portion of the masonry had fallen; and there", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "adaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "individual stones.  In this there was much that reminded me of", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "the specious totality of old wood-work which has rotted for long", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "years in some neglected vault, with no disturbance from the", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "breath of the external air.  Beyond  this indication of", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "extensive decay, however, the fabric gave little token of", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "instability.  Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "have discovered a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "from the roof of the building in front, made its way down the", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "wall in a zigzag direction, until it became lost in the sullen", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "waters of the tarn.", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "Noticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "house.  A servant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "Gothic archway of the hall.  A valet, of stealthy step, thence", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "conducted me, in silence, through many dark and intricate", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "passages in my progress to the studio of his master.  Much", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "that I encountered on the way contributed, I know not how, to", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already spoken.", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "While the objects around me--while the carvings of the ceilings,", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "the sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebon blackness of the", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "floors, and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "been accustomed from my infancy--while I hesitated not to", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "acknowledge how familiar was all this--I still wondered to find", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "stirring up.  On one of the staircases, I met the physician of", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "the family.  His countenance, I thought, wore a mingled", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "expression of low cunning and perplexity.  He accosted me with", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "trepidation and passed on.  The valet now threw open a door and", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "ushered me into the presence of his master.", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "The room in which I found myself was very large and lofty.", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "The windows were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a dis-", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "through the trellised panes, and served to render sufficiently", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "distinct the more prominent objects around; the eye, however,", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber, or", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling.  Dark draperies", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "hung upon the walls.  The general furniture was profuse,", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "comfortless, antique, and tattered.  Many books and musical", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "instruments lay scattered about, but failed to give any vitality", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "to the scene.  I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow.", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "An air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over and", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "pervaded all.", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "Upon my entrance, Usher rose from a sofa on which he had", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "been lying at full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "cordiality--of the constrained effort of the ennuye man of", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "the world.  A glance, however, at his countenance, convinced me", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "of his perfect sincerity.  We sat down; and for some moments,", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "while he spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity,", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "in so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher!  It was with", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "difficulty that I could bring myself to admit the identity of the", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "the character of his face had been at all times remarkable.  A", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "cadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid, and luminous", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew model,", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "finely-moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "want of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "tenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "regions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "easily to be forgotten.  And now in the mere exaggeration of the", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "prevailing character of these features, and of the expression", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "they were wont to convey, lay so much of change that I doubted to", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "miraculous lustre of the eye, above all things startled and even", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "awed me.  The silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow all", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated rather", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "its Arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "In the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "incoherence--an inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "habitual trepidancy--an excessive nervous agitation.  For", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "something of this nature I had indeed been prepared, no less by", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "his letter, than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits, and", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "and temperament.  His action was alternately vivacious and", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "sullen.  His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "(when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance) to", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "that species of energetic concision--that abrupt, weighty,", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "unhurried, and hollow-sounding enunciation--that leaden, self-", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "balanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance, which may be", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "opium, during the periods of his most intense excitement.", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "It was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "earnest desire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "afford him.  He entered, at some length, into what he conceived", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "to be the nature of his malady.  It was, he said, a", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "constitutional and a family evil, and one for which he despaired", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "to find a remedy--a mere nervous affection, he immediately added,", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "host of unnatural sensations.  Some of these, as he detailed", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "them, interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms,", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "insipid food was alone endurable; he could wear only garments of", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "certain texture; the odours of all flowers were oppressive; his", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "eyes were tortured by even a faint light; and there were but", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "peculiar sounds, and these from stringed instruments, which did", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "not inspire him with horror.", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "To an anomalous species of terror I found him a bounden", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "slave.  \"I shall perish,\" said he, \"I must perish in this", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "deplorable folly.  Thus, thus, and not otherwise, shall I be", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "lost.  I dread the events of the future, not in themselves, but", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "in their results.  I shudder at the thought of any, even the most", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "agitation of soul.  I have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger,", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "except in its absolute effect--in terror.  In this unnerved--in", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "this pitiable condition--I feel that the period will sooner or", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "later arrive when I must abandon life and reason together, in", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "some struggle with the grim phantasm, FEAR.\"", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "I learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "equivocal hints, another singular feature of his mental", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "condition.  He was enchained by certain superstitious impressions", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "mere form and substance of his family mansion, had, by", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "dint of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit--an", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "effect which the physique of the grey walls and turrets, and", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "of the dim tarn into which they all looked down, had, at length,", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "brought about upon the morale of his existence.", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "He admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "more natural and far more palpable origin--to the severe and", "gid": "932"}

{"s": "apartment, and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared.", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "I regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with", "gid": "932"}

{"s": "upon her, my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the", "gid": "932"}

{"s": "hands, and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinary", "gid": "932"}

{"s": "trickled many passionate tears.", "gid": "932"}

{"s": "partially cataleptical character, were the unusual diagnosis.", "gid": "932"}

{"s": "succumbed (as her brother told me at night with inexpressible", "gid": "932"}

{"s": "And now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "observable change came over the features of the mental disorder", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "of my friend.  His ordinary manner had vanished.  His ordinary", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "occupations were neglected or forgotten.  He roamed from chamber", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "to chamber with hurried, unequal, and objectless step.  The", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "pallor of his countenance had assumed, if possible, a more", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "ghastly hue--but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "out.  The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "more; and a tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "thought his unceasingly agitated mind was labouring with some", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "oppressive secret, to divulge which he struggled for the", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "necessary courage.  At times, again, I was obliged to resolve all", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "gazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an attitude of the", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "profoundest attention, as if listening to some imaginary", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "sound.  It was no wonder that his condition terrified--that it", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "infected me.  I felt creeping upon me, by slow yet certain", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "degrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "superstitions.", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "It was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "of the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "Madeline within the donjon, that I experienced the full power of", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "such feelings.  Sleep came not near my couch--while the hours", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "waned and waned away.  I struggled to reason off the nervousness", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "which had dominion over me.  I endeavoured to believe that much,", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "if not all of what I felt, was due to the bewildering influence", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "of the gloomy furniture of the room--of the dark and tattered", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "draperies, which, tortured into motion by the breath of a rising", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "tempest, swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "uneasily about the decorations of the bed.  But my efforts were", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "fruitless.  An irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame;", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "and, at length, there sat upon my very heart an incubus of", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "utterly causeless alarm.  Shaking this off with a gasp and a", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "struggle, I uplifted myself upon the pillows, and, peering", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber, hearkened--", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "of the storm, at long intervals, I knew not whence.  Overpowered", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "by an intense sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet unendurable,", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "no more during the night,) and endeavoured to arouse myself from", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "the pitiable condition into which I had fallen, by pacing rapidly", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "I had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention.  I presently", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "recognized it as that of Usher.  In an instant afterwards he", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "rapped, with a gentle touch, at my door, and entered, bearing a", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "lamp.  His countenance was, as usual, cadaverously wan--but,", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "moreover, there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes--an", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanour.  His", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "air appalled me--but anything was preferable to the solitude", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "which I had so long endured, and I even welcomed his presence as", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "a relief.", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "\"And you have not seen it?\" he said abruptly, after having", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "stared about him for some moments in silence--\"you have", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "not then seen it?--but, stay! you shall.\"  Thus speaking, and", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "having carefully shaded his lamp, he hurried to one of the", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "casements, and threw it freely open to the storm.", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "The impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "from our feet.  It was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "beautiful night, and one wildly singular in its terror and its", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "beauty.  A whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "vicinity; for there were frequent and violent alterations in the", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "direction of the wind; and the exceeding density of the clouds", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "(which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house) did", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "flew careering from all points against each other, without", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "passing away into the distance.  I say that even their exceeding", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "density did not prevent our perceiving this--yet we had no", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "glimpse of the moon or stars--nor was there any flashing forth of", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "agitated vapor, as well as all terrestrial objects immediately", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "around us, were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "about and enshrouded the mansion.", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "\"You must not--you shall not behold this!\" said I,", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "shudderingly, to Usher, as I led him, with a gentle violence,", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "from the window to a seat.  \"These appearances, which bewilder", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "you, are merely electrical phenomena not uncommon--or it may be", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "that they have their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "tarn.  Let us close this casement;--the air is chilling and", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "dangerous to your frame.  Here is one of your favourite romances.", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "The antique volume which I had taken up was the \"Mad", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "Trist\" of Sir Launcelot Canning; but I had called it a favourite", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "of Usher's more in sad jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there", "gid": "932"}

{"s": "friend.  It was, however, the only book immediately at hand; and", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "I indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "the hypochondriac, might find relief (for the history of mental", "gid": "932"}

{"s": "the wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "hearkened, or apparently hearkened, to the words of the tale, I", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "design.", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "I had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "Ethelred, the hero of the Trist, having sought in vain for", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to", "gid": "932"}

{"s": "\"And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "was now mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine", "gid": "932"}

{"s": "but, feeling the rain upon his shoulders, and fearing the rising", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "of the tempest, uplifted his mace outright, and, with blows, made", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "hand; and now pulling therewith sturdily, he so cracked, and", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry and", "gid": "932"}

{"s": "exact similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled and dull", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "one certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which Sir", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "Launcelot had so particularly described.  It was, beyond doubt,", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amid", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "the rattling of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinary", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "commingled noises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "itself, had nothing, surely, which should have interested or", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "disturbed me.  I continued the story:", "gid": "932"}
{"s": "\"But the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the", "gid": "932"}

{"s": "embraced but little more than one at a time. There was a sharp", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "turn at every twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "effect. To the right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "pursued the windings of the suite. These windows were of stained", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "glass whose color varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "eastern extremity was hung, for example, in blue&mdash;and", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "vividly blue were its windows. The second chamber was purple in", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes were purple. The", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "white&mdash;the sixth with violet. The seventh apartment was", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "the ceiling and down the walls, falling in heavy folds upon a", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "carpet of the same material and hue. But in this chamber only,", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "the color of the windows failed to correspond with the", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "decorations. The panes here were scarlet&mdash;a deep blood", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "color. Now in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "or candelabrum, amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "scattered to and fro or depended from the roof. There was no", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "of chambers. But in the corridors that followed the suite, there", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "stood, opposite to each window, a heavy tripod, bearing a brazier", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "glaringly illumined the room. And thus were produced a multitude", "gid": "1062"}

{"s": "hangings through the blood-tinted panes, was ghastly in the", "gid": "1062"}

{"s": "those who entered, that there were few of the company bold enough", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "western wall, a gigantic clock of ebony. Its pendulum swung to", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "and fro with a dull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "minute-hand made the circuit of the face, and the hour was to be", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "stricken, there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical, but of", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause,", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "momentarily, in their performance, to hearken to the sound; and", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "chimes of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "grew pale, and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "their brows as if in confused revery or meditation. But when the", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "echoes had fully ceased, a light laughter at once pervaded the", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "assembly; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "their own nervousness and folly, and made whispering vows, each", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "to the other, that the next chiming of the clock should produce", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "in them no similar emotion; and then, after the lapse of sixty", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "minutes (which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "the Time that flies), there came yet another chiming of the", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "clock, and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "meditation as before.</p>", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "revel. The tastes of the duke were peculiar. He had a fine eye", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "for colors and effects. He disregarded the <i>decora</i> of mere", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "fashion. His plans were bold and fiery, and his conceptions", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "glowed with barbaric lustre. There are some who would have", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "thought him mad. His followers felt that he was not. It was", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "necessary to hear and see and touch him to be <i>sure</i> that he", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "the seven chambers, upon occasion of this great", "gid": "1062"}

{"s": "phantasm&mdash;much of what has been since seen in", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "&ldquo;Hernani.&rdquo; There were arabesque figures with unsuited", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "madman fashions. There were much of the beautiful, much of the", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "wanton, much of the <i>bizarre</i>, something of the terrible,", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "and not a little of that which might have excited disgust. To and", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "dreams. And these&mdash;the dreams&mdash;writhed in and about,", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "taking hue from the rooms, and causing the wild music of the", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps. And, anon, there", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet.", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "And then, for a moment, all is still, and all is silent save the", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "voice of the clock. The dreams are stiff-frozen as they stand.", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "But the echoes of the chime die away&mdash;they have endured but", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "an instant&mdash;and a light, half-subdued laughter floats after", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "them as they depart. And now again the music swells, and the", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "dreams live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever, taking", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "from the tripods. But to the chamber which lies most westwardly", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "of the seven, there are now none of the maskers who venture; for", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "the night is waning away; and there flows a ruddier light through", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "appals; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet, there", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "emphatic than any which reaches <i>their</i> ears who indulge in", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "the more remote gaieties of the other apartments.</p>", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "beat feverishly the heart of life. And the revel went whirlingly", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "on, until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "evolutions of the waltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "cessation of all things as before. But now there were twelve", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock; and thus it", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "happened, perhaps, that more of thought crept, with more of time,", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "And thus too, it happened, perhaps, that before the last echoes", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were many", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "of no single individual before. And the rumor of this new", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "presence having spread itself whisperingly around, there arose at", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "disapprobation and surprise&mdash;then, finally, of terror, of", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "horror, and of disgust.</p>", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "such sensation. In truth the masquerade license of the night was", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "nearly unlimited; but the figure in question had out-Heroded", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "Herod, and gone beyond the bounds of even the prince&rsquo;s", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "indefinite decorum. There are chords in the hearts of the most", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "reckless which cannot be touched without emotion. Even with the", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "utterly lost, to whom life and death are equally jests, there are", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "stranger neither wit nor propriety existed. The figure was tall", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "and gaunt, and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "the grave. The mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat.", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "the face, was besprinkled with the scarlet horror.</p>", "gid": "1062"}

{"s": "to sustain its role, stalked to and fro among the waltzers) he", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "was seen to be convulsed, in the first moment with a strong", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "shudder either of terror or distaste; but, in the next, his brow", "gid": "1062"}

{"s": "the seven rooms loudly and clearly, for the prince was a bold and", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "of pale courtiers by his side. At first, as he spoke, there was a", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "intruder, who, at the moment was also near at hand, and now, with", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "who put forth hand to seize him; so that, unimpeded, he passed", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "within a yard of the prince&rsquo;s person; and, while the vast", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of the", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the", "gid": "1062"}

{"s": "maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice,", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all. He", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had approached, in rapid", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "impetuosity, to within three or four feet of the retreating", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "figure, when the latter, having attained the extremity of the", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer.", "gid": "1062"}
{"s": "There was a sharp cry&mdash;and the dagger dropped gleaming upon", "gid": "1062"}
